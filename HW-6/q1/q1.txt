We should use a tuple instead of a list. The main difference between tuples and lists is that once data is entered into a tuple it cannot be changed whereas data entered into a list can be changed. However, we know that the values of this particular data structure won't ever be changed, so we do not need to worry about this difference. Next, note that we would like to access and search the structure several times. Tuples are generally more efficient than lists in the memory size and average lookup time, so using a tuple is preferable to using a list in this case, and we don't need to worry about the limitations of tuples since we won't need to change any values in the data structure later.
